    "content": "\u2014Information accurate as of: 1159 Update\nTrees are naturally occurring world objects in Rust. Players can harvest trees for Wood using any gathering tool such as a Rock, Hatchet, or Pickaxe. Harvested wood is added to the player inventory and can be used for Crafting various items or as fuel for Camp Fires and Furnaces. \nThe amount of wood harvested from trees is generally proportional to its size and type. Large trees can be harvested for around 650 wood, depending on the tool used. When all of a tree's wood is harvested, the tree falls, giving the player an amount of wood higher than before. However, if only some wood is harvested and the tree is left for a few days, the wood will be replenished.",

Wood Piles were a much better alternative as they allowed players to gather Wood more quickly. However, when Wood Piles were scarce (and the player only needed a small amount of wood to craft a Wood Shelter or Camp Fire), then Trees were fine. If the player used a Pick Axe on the tree, they could get 2 Wood per hit. In contrast with Experimental Rust, trees in Legacy did not despawn after being fully harvested, and players would see a message stating 'There's no wood left here' if they attempted to continue gathering from it."
