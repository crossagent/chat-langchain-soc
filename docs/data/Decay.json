    "title": "Decay",
    "content": "Decay is a feature added to the game because of the massive amounts of player-made structures on the map, which the servers can't handle.\nDecay works by slowly decreasing the health of the foundations of a structure. If left unattended, the decaying structures will break and, in co-ordination with the stability system, the rest of the building will soon fall apart as well, ultimately leading to the total destruction of a structure. Unlike in earlier builds, decay now affects any and all structures, no matter what the tier or location. Higher tiered structures will generally decay slower, and after a longer delay.",

Metal Fragments fix metal structures, Wood fixes wood structures, and so on. To repair, take the Hammer tool, and ensure you have the relevant resources in your inventory. Hit the structure by left clicking, and on each successful hit, the health of the structure will visibly and physically increase until it is repaired fully. If a structure has already collapsed, it is not repairable and must be rebuilt."

            "content": "There were two server variables that were relevant for controlling the decay speed of structures in Legacy:\ndecay.decaytickrate (default 300)\nThis controls the interval in which all outstanding decay on the server is performed. The faster (shorter) the interval, the more often decay is applied to structures.\ndecay.deploy_maxhealth_sec (default N/A)\nMaxhealth controls how much damage will be dealt per second. However, the values for these variables are not straight forward to set. Changing the decay time of structures should be done by changing the deploy_maxhealth_sec setting. Changing decaytickrate is only necessary if there are too many structures on the server that cause lag every time the damage is applied.\nTo estimate the time a structure needs to decay with given decay settings the following formula can be used:\nDamager per Time unit = Structure Max Health / (deploy_maxhealth_sec / decaytickrate)\nThis can be used to calculate the amount of time needed for an untouched structure to fully decay:\nDays until complete decay = Structure Max Health / (Damage per Time unit / decaytickrate) / 60 / 60 / 24\nExample\ndeploytickrate = 300masmis\ndeploy_maxhealth_sec = 432500\nThis setting will result in the decay of a normal 1000 hp Wood Wall\n1000 hp / (432500 hp / 300 s) = 1000 hp / 1441.66 parts of hp per 300 seconds = 0.6936448261 hp per 300 seconds\n1000 hp / (0.6936448261 hp per 300 seconds / 300 seconds) / 60s / 60m / 24h = 1000 hp / 0.00231214942 hp/s / 60s / 60m / 24h\n= 432498 s / 60s / 60m / 24h = 5 days until 100% decay\nWith the above settings a standard 1000 hp Wooden Wall will take 5 days until is has decayed completely and take 0.693645 hp damage every 300 / 60 = 5 minutes after 24 hours of idle.\nThis graph will show the decay time in days by deploy_maxhealth_sec with deploytickrate at 300 for a structure with 1000 hp (e.g. Wood Wall).\n \nMechanics\nAttack\nDamage Types \u2022 Projectiles\nEnvironment\nAnimals \u2022 Barrels \u2022 Biomes \u2022 Flora \u2022 Loot Crates \u2022 Monuments \u2022 Rocks \u2022 Trees\nGameplay\nAttack Helicopter \u2022 Airdrops \u2022 Building \u2022 Combat \u2022 Crafting \u2022 Gathering \u2022 Raiding \u2022 Repairing \u2022 Researching\nPlayer\nFood & Hunger \u2022 Health \u2022 Hydration & Thirst \u2022 Protection \u2022 Sleeping \u2022 Spawning\nXP System\nExperience \u2022 Skill Tree \u2022 Tech Tree\nStatus Effects\nBleeding \u2022 Building Privilege \u2022 Comfort \u2022 Injured \u2022 Poisoning \u2022 Radiation \u2022 Starvation & Dehydration \u2022 Warmth \u2022 Wet & Drowning \u2022 Wounded"
