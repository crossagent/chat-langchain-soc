When bleeding out, you cannot take any action except using voice chat. Your character will reach his arm out periodically to visually signal for help. Anyone can revive or loot you while in this state by pressing their use key on your character. You have a small chance to revive yourself when you are bleeding out, but currently, the criteria for this to happen is vague; some players have reported having high water/calories will increase the chance. If you do not recover on your own, you must be revived by another player or you will die.\nWhen you die, all your items are left on your body until it either despawns (despawn time?) or someone loots and/or destroys it. The item you were wielding is dropped onto the floor.\nUpon death, you're given two choices: to respawn in a random area on the map, or to respawn at a camp (Sleeping Bag/Bed).
