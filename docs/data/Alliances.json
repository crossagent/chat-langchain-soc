    "content": "Alliances are groups of players that work together towards a common goal. The size of alliances can vary greatly from 2 to 20+ players. Alliances also have different objectives such as survival, defense, or raiding. Some alliances are well-structured, with clear leaders and objectives, while others may be loose groups with no player being in charge. More loosely-formed groups may elect a temporary leader to represent them in negotiations or trade.",
