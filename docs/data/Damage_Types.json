            "content": "This damage is self explanatory, and is caused by damage from gunshots (and maybe Wooden Arrows). Regular clothing will not do much to protect one against bullet damage, but it is better than nothing. Armor however, is very effective at protecting against bullet damage."

            "content": "Main Article: Cold\nCold damage isn't too much of a problem during the day (unless you live in an arctic or mountain biome), but at night, being too Cold can result in the difference between life and death. It is very easy to avoid being cold. You can either wear an adequate amount of clothing to stay warm, or stay close to a Camp Fire and utilize its Comfort buff. Alternatively, you can stay within a Temperate biome and the temperature will usually still be warm enough for you to avoid taking Cold damage. Even a simple pair of pants is almost good enough to avoid freezing to death on a cold Rust night."

There is no specific, very effective counter to explosion damage, but avoiding the blast, as well as equipping armor can save your life."

The most effective way of combating this damage is with anti-rad pills, which cannot be crafted but instead found inside Loot Crates. Hazmat Suits can also be worn to prevent radiation damage. Clothing and other armor will protect against radiation to a small degree."
