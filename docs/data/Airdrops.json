    "content": "Airdrops are events which will cause a plane to fly over the map and drop a crate containing various supplies. These supplies are dropped in a large green container which will slowly parachute to the ground.\nSome of the most valuable items in the game can be obtained from this event. You will hear a loud noise of a passing plane when the event starts, and a red light can be seen blinking on the bottom of the plane by nearby players. \nThis event can happen around once an hour, but can also be activated by the host of a server, or by using a Supply Signal, which can rarely spawn in military crates.\nThe plane which supplies these Airdrops is a variant of the C-130.",

Snap Traps and Land Mines from the drop itself may be used to booby-trap the drop site, on low population servers, but it is most likely that there will be a firefight, or one player will grab the loot and run."
