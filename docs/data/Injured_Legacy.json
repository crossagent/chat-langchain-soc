    "content": "The Injured status effect can occur from falling or jumping off high places. It keeps you crouched and slows your walking as though you are crafting something. You cannot sprint, and it is very hard (if possible at all) to jump while injured. You will eventually recover after about a minute of being injured. Being injured usually also involves fall damage, as that is usually the method of injury. This effect has been removed from the experimental version of rust and most servers.\nMechanics\nAttack\nDamage Types \u2022 Projectiles\nEnvironment\nAnimals \u2022 Barrels \u2022 Biomes \u2022 Flora \u2022 Loot Crates \u2022 Monuments \u2022 Rocks \u2022 Trees\nGameplay\nAttack Helicopter \u2022 Airdrops \u2022 Building \u2022 Combat \u2022 Crafting \u2022 Gathering \u2022 Raiding \u2022 Repairing \u2022 Researching\nPlayer\nFood & Hunger \u2022 Health \u2022 Hydration & Thirst \u2022 Protection \u2022 Sleeping \u2022 Spawning\nXP System\nExperience \u2022 Skill Tree \u2022 Tech Tree\nStatus Effects\nBleeding \u2022 Building Privilege \u2022 Comfort \u2022 Injured \u2022 Poisoning \u2022 Radiation \u2022 Starvation & Dehydration \u2022 Warmth \u2022 Wet & Drowning \u2022 Wounded",
