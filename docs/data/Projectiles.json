    "content": "See also: Ammunition\nProjectiles are items which are either thrown or fired. They travel in a parabolic arc and are subject to gravity and air resistance. Some projectiles have a chance to ricochet off of the environment. There are two main types of projectiles: throwable melee weapons and fired ammunition from ranged weapons. Projectiles are subject to bullet damage protection values from attire items (armour and clothing).\nYou can throw melee weapons by equipping them and holding the right mouse button (aka RMB). Then, press the left mouse button to throw the weapon a short distance in front of you. Some examples of throwable melee weapons are the Stone Hatchet, the Hatchet, Stone Pick Axe, Pick Axe, Mace, Wooden Spear, Stone Spear, Longsword, and other weapons. Typically, a thrown attack will land a higher damage hit as opposed to a regular melee attack.\nThe other main category of projectiles are ammunition, which are used by ranged weapons to inflict a ranged attack. For example, the Crossbow uses Wooden Arrows and High Velocity Arrows. There are many variants of ammunition. They have many different traits, advantages and disadvantages.\nMechanics\nAttack\nDamage Types \u2022 Projectiles\nEnvironment\nAnimals \u2022 Barrels \u2022 Biomes \u2022 Flora \u2022 Loot Crates \u2022 Monuments \u2022 Rocks \u2022 Trees\nGameplay\nAttack Helicopter \u2022 Airdrops \u2022 Building \u2022 Combat \u2022 Crafting \u2022 Gathering \u2022 Raiding \u2022 Repairing \u2022 Researching\nPlayer\nFood & Hunger \u2022 Health \u2022 Hydration & Thirst \u2022 Protection \u2022 Sleeping \u2022 Spawning\nXP System\nExperience \u2022 Skill Tree \u2022 Tech Tree\nStatus Effects\nBleeding \u2022 Building Privilege \u2022 Comfort \u2022 Injured \u2022 Poisoning \u2022 Radiation \u2022 Starvation & Dehydration \u2022 Warmth \u2022 Wet & Drowning \u2022 Wounded"
