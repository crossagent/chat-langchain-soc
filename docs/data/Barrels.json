    "content": "Barrels are hollow, metal, cylindrical containers and a type of destructible world object found in Experimental Rust. They typically contain low-tier components, 1 scrap and resources, which drop on the ground after the barrel has been demolished. 4 different types of Barrels exist. Spawn locations vary from areas in and around Monuments to Roads to Junk Piles, and usually depend on the Barrel's type. For all types of barrels, there is a chance that no loot may spawn after a player demolishes them. (More so with the Oil Barrel)",
